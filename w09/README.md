# Prelude

Before getting started with using Docker, it's a good idea to motivate and explain _what_ Docker actually is so you don't just type commands and see stuff happen.

## Why?
![Works on my machine](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQErd8DR8mH1HQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1690344054617?e=1735171200&v=beta&t=I9ab3xaDdiDDksSkN0bzDAqIW0k-JY_-AsyFxHd7nCs "why docker")

To avoid the above from happening. Or even shorter -- reproducability.

Docker essentially allows running code in an isolated and agnostic way from the operating system, making it crucial for reproducible, automated workflows for both normal DevOps and MLOps.

Itemised list for convenience:

* Reproducible and consistent delivery
* CI/CD pipelines
* Portable and collaborative
* Efficient use of resources

## What?

> [!NOTE]
> Fun fact: Docker is written in Go.

Docker is a way to create a virtual instance of a compute resources. However, unlike virtual machines with their own complete operating system, Docker uses lightweight containers instead.

The key thing is these containers have their own filesystem, dependencies, processes and such, which allows you to run an application in isolation of your operating system.

There are three main components to Docker:

1. Dockerfiles
2. Docker images
3. Docker containers

You will explore each of these components more closely through the upcoming exercises, but a short introduction is in order.

**Dockerfiles** are a set of instructions that will be used to build a **Docker image**. These instructions include information about the *base image* and the *commands* that will be executed (such as installing packages etc).

A **Docker image** is the output from building the **Dockerfile**. They are immutable, but you can build on top of other images by using them as *base images*.

These images can be tagged and versioned, which also makes it easy to roll back and such to other versions. While we will not touch on this too much, you typically also have image repositories that you can push and pull your images to/from ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) being the default).

They also have a layered structure where each command/instruction is essentially cached. That means fast and efficient build times when only making changes in parts of the code.

When you want to run the **Docker image**, it spins it up in a **Docker container** as an isolated runtime environment. Once complete, the container shuts down and releases the resources (compute and storage).

Although they are based on the immutable **Docker image**, it is possible to customize the **Docker container** at runtime. This can also be a way to ensure the same environment for *dev* and *prod* work.

But enough theory for now. Let's start with the exercises!



# Exercises

> [!NOTE]
> **Learning outcomes**
> <i> By the end of the exercises, we expect you to be able to do the following:</i>
> <ul>
> <li>Write/create a basic Dockerfile that can run a basic DS project [e.g., CCDS]</li>
> <li>Explain the workflow and processes for using Docker</li>
> <li>Motivate the typical ways why you would modify Docker containers at runtime</li>
> <li>Describe image repositories and explain their usage</li>
> </ul>

As described in the previous section, Docker is really a way to run code in a reproducible way.

## Exercise 0: Installation



1. <details> <summary> Install Docker Desktop+Engine</summary>
   If you haven't already, you need to make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker Engine</a>. The easiest way is to do it through <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>. For Windows users, you will also need to install <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a> if you haven't already.
   </details>
2. <details> <summary> Test your Docker installation is working</summary>
   In the terminal, run <code>docker run hello-world</code>

   If it works, great! If not, try googling the issue.

   A common issue is that the Docker daemon not running. If you installed it with Docker Desktop, make sure that program is running.
   </details>

## Exercise 1: Create a training Dockerfile

<!-- Example details text
1. <details> <summary> Exercise summary </summary>
   Exercise description
   </details>
-->

1. <details> <summary> Build out our CCDS repo with a train.py script </summary>
   Exercise description
   </details>
2. <details> <summary> Create train.dockerfiler </summary>
   Exercise description
   </details>
3. <details> <summary> Find appropiate base-image </summary>
   Exercise description
   </details>
4. <details> <summary> Modify example Dockerfile to fit our use-case</summary>
   Inspired from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/">this website:</a>

   <pre><code>
   FROM python:3.12
   WORKDIR /usr/local/app
   # Install the application dependencies
   COPY requirements.txt ./
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   # Copy in the source code
   COPY src ./src
   EXPOSE 5000
   # Setup an app user so the container doesn't run as the root user
   RUN useradd app
   USER app
   CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
   </code></pre>
   </details>

## Exercise 2: Build the image

1. <details> <summary> Build the train.dockerfile </summary>
   Normally you just need to run <code>docker build .</code>, but since we want to use a specific .dockerfile, we have to modify it slightly:
   <details><summary>Hint:</summary><code>docker build -f train.dockerfile .</code></details>

   </details>

2. <details> <summary> Add a meaningful name by version/tag </summary>
   Just building the image can make it hard to find again.

   Adding tags when building the image is typically the easiest way to deal with this. You can also add tags after it has been built but then you need to know the image id.

   <details><summary>Hint:</summary><code>docker build -f train.dockerfile -t iris-train:1.0.0 .</code></details>
   </details>

3. <details> <summary> Changing files/fixing errors </summary>
   It's possible that you need to rebuild the image because of some errors. Can you spot what the error is now?
   
   <details><summary>Hint:</summary>Python version and requirements.txt does not have scikit-learn</details>
   
   <pre>Question: why is it faster building it now?</pre>
   </details>
   

## Exercise 3: Run your image

1. <details> <summary> Run your latest image </summary>
   The basic <code>docker run &lt;image&gt;</code> is pretty straight-forward. But what is your image id?

   <details><summary>Hint to find list of images</summary><code>docker images</code></details>
   </details>

2. <details> <summary> Solving issues with different arguments </summary>
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/">Full list of arguments here</a>
    
   -i (--interactive) for going "into" the container and run commands interactively.

   -d (--detach) to don't have the process run in your terminal but detached in the background instead.

   -p (--publish)
   <details><code>docker run -p 10000:8080 iris-train</code></details>

   -v (--volume)
   <details><code>docker run -v ./artifacts:/usr/local/app/artifacts iris-train</code></details>

   -e (--env) is for setting environment variables, which can sometimes be useful whenever using env variables in your code. 
   </details>

3. <details> <summary> Check running containers </summary>
   Checking running containers can be done by <code>docker ps</code>. What about stopped containers?
   <details><code>docker ps -a</code></details>

   </details>

## Exercise 4: Push and pull

1. <details><summary> Find an interesting <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?categories=Machine+Learning+%26+AI">AI/ML image</a> and pull it</summary>
   <code>docker pull jupyter/scipy-notebook</code>

   Or run it directly:
   <code>docker run jupyter/scipy-notebook</code>

   <pre>Question: Suggested arguments for running this image?</pre> 
   <details><summary>My suggestions:</summary><code>-p 10000:8888 -d</code></details>
   </details>

2. <details><summary> Pushing your image</summary>
   This will require setting up a user that can push to whichever registry you want to push it to. Generally it would follow this structure:
   <pre><code>
   docker login &lt;REGISTRY_HOST&gt;:&lt;REGISTRY_PORT&gt;
   docker tag &lt;IMAGE_ID&gt; &lt;REGISTRY_HOST&gt;:&lt;REGISTRY_PORT&gt;/&lt;APPNAME>:&lt;APPVERSION&gt;
   docker push &lt;REGISTRY_HOST&gt;:&lt;REGISTRY_PORT&gt;/&lt;APPNAME>:&lt;APPVERSION&gt;
   </code></pre>

   An example would look like:
   <pre><code>
   docker login repo.company.com:3456
   docker tag 19fcc4aa71ba repo.company.com:3456/myapp:0.1
   docker push repo.company.com:3456/myapp:0.1
   </code></pre>

   Or in our case with default Docker Hub:

   <pre><code>
   docker login --username jeppetk
   docker tag 90c46295c455 jeppetk/iris-train:initial
   docker push jeppetk/iris-train
   </code></pre>
   </details>

3. <details><summary> What do the hashes represent when pushing/pulling?</summary>
   It's the different layers. This can be confirmed with the  command <code>docker inspect 90c46295c455</code>
   </details>   

## Exercise 5: Clean up

1. <details> <summary>Check local images</summary>
   <code>docker images</code>
   </details>

2. <details> <summary>Remove images</summary>
   <code>docker rmi IMAGEID</code>
   </details>
